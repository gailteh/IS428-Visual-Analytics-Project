                        <p>
                            The issue of the labor force in the United States has been a subject of significant concern, and it's why our team has embarked on a journey of data visualization and analytics. Over the years, the U.S. labor market has faced various challenges, with critical turning points like the 2010 recession leaving a lasting impact. The recession resulted in a severe economic downturn, causing a surge in unemployment rates as businesses struggled and downsized their workforce. Millions of individuals found themselves without jobs, and this pivotal event reshaped the nation's labor landscape. Our mission is to provide valuable insights through visual analytics and visualization to help both experts and the public understand the complex dynamics of the labor force, including the effects of such critical events. By delving into the data, we aim to shed light on the evolving landscape of employment in the United States and inform discussions on how to address these challenges.

                        <h2>Gender</h2>

                        <p>Our team conducted a thorough analysis of gender roles within the U.S. labor force over time, recognizing that understanding the nuances of gender dynamics is key to comprehending the labor market and advocating for equitable policies. Visualizing gender data not only helps us grasp the division and disparities in workforce participation but also spotlights issues such as wage inequality and job segregation. This effort aims to highlight patterns of inequality and stimulate conversations that could lead to policy reforms for gender equality in the workplace.

                            Moreover, by charting the progress and challenges women and other gender groups face, we can trace the impact of sociopolitical movements and legislation on gender equality in the labor market. Our visualization seeks to provide insights into the intersection of gender with economic and social trends, informing strategies that ensure an inclusive labor market where all genders have equal opportunities to thrive.</p>

                        <p>
                            We can see how the gap between men and women through time decreases in size as well. This shows that the employment rate over the years has been significantly better for women, as compared to back then. This sheds light on the fact that gender equality has improved in society over time - and more people are willing to hire women at the same rate as men. The gap between women and men has decreased from 10,000 to around 3,000 throught time. The sharp drop in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 has affected both genders equally with the rate affecting more men than women.

                            As we navigate through the mesmerizing animation, several compelling observations come to light. Firstly, a notable pattern emerges, revealing a persistent high unemployment rate within the 20-24 age group over the years. 
                            This highlights a consistent vulnerability within this particular age bracket, which warrants further exploration and attention. Additionally, a significant historical marker reveals itself in the year 2010, coinciding with the great recession. 
                            During this turbulent period, a palpable surge in unemployment rates resonated across all age groups, reflecting the widespread economic hardships faced by the nation.

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                            Our team embarked on an in-depth exploration of age in relation to the labor force in the United States over the years for several compelling reasons. Visualizing age-related data plays a significant role in shedding light on various aspects of the labor market and societal dynamics.
                            <br><br>
                            First and foremost, age is a critical factor when analyzing labor force trends. It has a profound impact on employment, retirement, and workforce composition. By dissecting age-related data and representing it through graphs and visualizations, we gain a nuanced understanding of the workforce's demographic structure and its evolution. 
                            <br><br>
                            One of the crucial reasons to visualize age-related data is to uncover the possibility of age discrimination in the US labor market over the years. Age discrimination, whether in hiring, retention, or promotion, is a pertinent issue. By examining trends, patterns, and changes in the employment rates of different age groups, our visualizations aim to detect disparities or biases. 
                            This scrutiny can help highlight areas where discrimination might exist, encouraging informed discussions and potential policy changes to ensure equal opportunities for individuals of all ages.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, age-related data can reveal essential insights into workforce dynamics, such as retirement trends, labor force participation rates, and the influence of economic events, like recessions, on different age groups. We believe that by visualizing this data comprehensively, we can provide a comprehensive view of 
                            how age impacts the labor force, identify potential challenges, and propose strategies to address them.
                            <br><br>
                            In summary, our focus on age-related labor force data is driven by its significance in understanding demographic shifts, the potential presence of age discrimination, and the broader dynamics that affect individuals' participation in the workforce. By visualizing this data, we aim to contribute to informed discussions and promote policies that create a fair and inclusive labor market for all age groups.

                        <h2>Highlight Tables</h2>
                        <p>
                            After examining the line chart depicting the trends in unemployment rates across various age groups over the years, we have transitioned our focus to highlight tables to gain a more granular understanding of this data. 
                            The move to highlight tables is driven by the need to scrutinize the specific years and their corresponding unemployment rates for each age group. These tables allow us to delve deeper into the temporal aspects of the labor force dynamics, providing a clear and concise overview of the variations in unemployment across different demographic segments. 
                            The strength of highlight tables lies in their ability to present data in a structured format that facilitates year-by-year comparisons, making it easier to identify patterns, anomalies, and changes over time. 
                            By using these tables, we can pinpoint the exact moments when shifts in unemployment trends occurred within each age category, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of labor market dynamics.

                            The stream graph paints a fascinating tapestry of employment trends, and upon closer examination, several intriguing observations come to the fore. Much like the heatmap, it accentuates the significance of the pivotal years, 2010 and 2020, displaying vivid fluctuations that mirror the nation's economic landscape. 
                            However, what distinguishes the stream graph is its capacity to illustrate the interconnectedness of different age groups and their collective contribution to these trends. 
                            It provides a holistic view, revealing how each demographic band has fared in the larger context. This is in contrast to the heatmap, which primarily highlights age-specific rates, and the line graph, which may not capture the intricacies of overlap between age groups. 
                            The stream graph is a masterful storyteller, showcasing not only the individual narratives of each age bracket but also the synergy that exists among them, making it an invaluable tool for comprehending the multifaceted web of employment trends in the United States.

                            Based on the multi-line chart above, a clear pattern emerges when we examine the historical unemployment rates. Notably, the group with an educational qualification lower than high school diploma experience
                            the highest average annual unemployment rate of all time, followed by High School Graduates and those owning a College or Associate's Degree. The data reinforces the challenges faced by the group with limited 
                            formal education, as shown in the chart where they consistently maintained the highest rates of unemployment.

                            The chart highlights the disparities in unemployment rates based on educational attainment but also emphasizes the importance of education in achieving greater employment stability and economic security. It 
                            underscores the potential benefits of higher education in mitigating the impact of economic downturns and facilitating career opportunities.

                        <div id="edu-roc" style="padding: 2%;"></div>
                        <p>
                            Though we know that people with a certification less than High School Diploma has the highest average annual unemployment rate, we want to know about how the unemployment rate 
                            varies across the years, did . From the above graph illustrating the rate of changes in average annual unemployment rate, we can see that the width of the stream representing people with 
                            educational attainment of less than High School diploma is consistently the largest proportion. 
                            <br><br>
                            The rate of change is obtained by using the previous year as the basis for calculation to see how much has the unemployment range changes after a year.

                        <div id="edu-treemap" style="padding: 2%;"></div>
                        <p>
                            The animated treemap show us the change in average annual unemployment rate in US from 1993 to 2023. The size of the graph changes
                            with the average unemployment rate. While most of the years show relatively small portion, there are years that have a large size that
                            covers most of the canva, which are 2009, 2010 and 2020.
                            <br><br>
                            The stated years are known to be after major events such as 2008 Financial Crisis and 2019 Coronavirus pandemic. The major events have led to 
                            massive layoffs and raised the unemployment rate of the following year(s).
